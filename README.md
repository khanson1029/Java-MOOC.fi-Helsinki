# Java-MOOC.fi-Helsinki

This is a collection of java excercises completed from the University of Helsinki's MOOC.  In every project the work that I have completed myself is found in the src folder.  The other files are provided by the University of Helsinki for testing purposes.  I have included these files in case anyone is interested.
